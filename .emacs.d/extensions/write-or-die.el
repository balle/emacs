;;; write-or-die.el --- deletes word from buffer if you stop typing for to long

;; Version: 0.1a

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; An emacs version of Dr. Wicked's "Write-or-die" webapp, by Duncan Mortimer <dmorti@gmail.com>
;;
;; As soon as it is write-or-die-go is invoked, the time spent writing and the number of
;; words written are tracked.
;;
;; However, if you stop writing for some period of time, the buffer
;; changes colour to give you some warning, and then words are deleted
;; from the end of the document at a rate of 1 per second.  Beginning
;; writing again stops this.
;;
;; TODO:
;;
;; - Need to work out what variables need to be made buffer-local etc.
;;   They don't behave quite as I expected them to...
;; - Reinstate write-or-die-timer each second, rather than use the repeat feature.
;;   (i.e. so that bad things don't happen if emacs happens to freeze for a while...)
;; - Get it to work smoothely with colour themes; i.e. instead of changing to a white background by
;;   default, need to change to the initial background colour. (17/12/2008)
;;
;; Please let me know if this is useful to you, or if you have any suggestions!

;;; History:
;;
;; - 2009-12-09 incorporated Tom Breton's suggested change to word-count (see wiki page)
;;
;; - 2012-06-19 patched by balle - i dont like that background changing stuff

;;; Code:
