;;;
;;; The way I got these is usually by looking at the current definition,
;;; using git blame in one screen to locate which commit last modified it,
;;; and git log in another to determine which release that made it in.
;;; It is OK for some of the below definitions to be or become obsolete,
;;; as long as it will make do with versions older than the tagged version:
;;; if ASDF is more recent, its more recent version will win.
;;;
;;; If your software is hacking ASDF, use its internals.
;;; If you want ASDF utilities in user software, please use ASDF-UTILS.
