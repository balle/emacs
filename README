My personal emacs config

Requirements:

clangd
pyright

Afterwards just add three links
cd ~
ln -s emacs/.emacs
ln -s emacs/.emacs.d

Documentation about keyboard shortcuts can be found in emacs.org

For GNUS copy and edit .mailcap and .gnus-custom. Link .gnus to ~/.gnus and
create a ~/.authinfo with the following content

machine mail.domain.com login username@domain.com port 25 password MyPASS

It's better practice to save the above in ~/.authinfo.gpg and let Emacs
en- / decrypt the content.
