Just a tiny repository to keep my emacs environment in sync.
Features: Python, Django, Perl, C, Latex + Ispell, Flyspell, Flymake, Auto-Completion, Yasnippets, Ido,
Kill-Ring-Browser, Undo-Tree, Magit, printing, project management, org-mode with redmine support and more
Customizations should be saved in ~/.emacs-custom

Installation:

emacs
gxmessage
xclip
xpp

Afterwards just add three links
cd ~
ln -s emacs/.emacs
ln -s emacs/.emacs.d
ln -s emacs/.emacs-snippets
ln -s emacs/.eshell

cd emacs/.emacs.d/extensions/auctex && ./configure && make
cd emacs/.emacs.d/extensions/emacs-jedi && sudo pip install -r requirements.txt

For more performance you could now once compile all elisp files. 
Therefore goto the *scratch* and execute

(require 'find-lisp)

(mapc
 (lambda (x) (byte-compile-file x))
 (find-lisp-find-files "~/.emacs.d/" "\\.el$"))


Documentation about keyboard shortcuts can be found in emacs.org
